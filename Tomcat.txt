Tomcat-1 06/01/2023
--------------------
To deploy the applciaiton , we have the application server

running the jar file, "java -jar jarfilename"

But, for running the war and ear file, we should have applcaiton server.
Applicaiton server:
--------------------
Jboss (it is oudated one better se wildefly) --->from 1.x to 7.x --->from 8.x to till latest version calling as  renamed to wildfly
wildfly  ---> both can support, war files and ear files, it is open source.

websphere Applicaiton server(WAS)---> IBM VENDOR, to deloy the war and ear files

weblogic server --> Oracle  --> these two not open source.

Tomcat  -->Apache tomcat ---> it is used only deploy the "war" files
This is inbuild server along with springboot

Many of the application developed by uisng springboot frame works to develope the  ,microservice architecture


"MOST OF THE BANK APPLCAIOTNS DEPLOYED IN "WAS" AND "WILDFLY", MAIN THING IS SECURITY, AND IT WON'T CRASH IN HEAVY TRAFFIC TIME ALSO
FOR BIG APPLICATIONS."
Harshada2806
spring boot --> Java Advanced Framework

ApacheTomcat: it is light weight along with spring boot tomcat is there, and it is advanced frame work.
-------------
It is an opensource java based web applciaiotn server. It can support only the "war" files.
Tomcat supports only java applcaiotns , not other.

to down load Tomcat, mostly use 9.0 version, by using devops tool page

Binary Distribution:
-------------------
we need to use the binary distribution to deploy the applcaiotns

wget https://downloads.apache.org/tomcat/tomcat-9/v9.0.70/bin/apache-tomcat-9.0.70.zip.asc


source code Distribution:
--------------------------
To enhance the etra features on top of exist features use the source code Distribution


we can choose either zip or tar file.

Tomcat Directories Strcture:
-----------------------------
bin --> it contains all binary files
--------
startup.sh(only works for linux/mac) , startup.bat (windows)  --> it work for linux/mac
shutdown.sh, shutdown.bat 
catalina.sh, catalina.bat, [sh catalina.sh start, sh catalina.sh stop] to start and stop the tomcat server.
version.sh, version.bat  --> like this various script are there

conf---> It contains all important configuration files
server.xml and tomcat-users.xml

maven conf file --> settings.xml

lib --> libraries, it is nothing but jar files
jar files

logs --> log files, by defaulkt it is empty.
-----
once start the Tomcat, it is going to create 4 log files

Q) whAT ARE the logs files will generate once start the tomcat server?

manager.log
hostmanager-log
catalina.out
locahost.log 

webapps --> it contains all the webapplocaitons .5 default applications. 
---------
whaterver the applcaiotn we are going to deploy it will available in the webapps directory.

work---> once the applcaiton starts it is going to create  some  files, while running the applcation.those files is going to save or keep  in work directory
-------
temp ---> It contains all temporary files.
----

Tomcat server Intsallation:
--------------------------
Prereqities software
-------------------
java,
install JDK 11

cat /etc/*release , it will give the Distribution details, which one we are using

yum install wget ,first
check the URL in new web page

follow the Mithun vlog to down load further softwares

cd /opt/apache-tomcat-9.0.68 --> tomcat home directory

chmod u+x(execute permissions) *.sh (giving permission to all .sh files)

creating two soft links to start and stop tomcat

ln -s /opt/apache-tomcat-9.0.68/bin/startup.sh/usr/bin/startTomcat
ln -s /opt/apache-tomcat-9.0.68/bin/shutdown.sh/usr/bin/stopTomcat


ps -ef | grep "tomcat", to show the tomcat details

before access the tomcat new webpage, enbale the 8080 port number in security group


go to webapps/
/manager
/META-INF/
/vi contect.xml, comment
<!-- valve className -->

go to conf/
/tomcat-users.xml
at line nmber 56, <user username="mithuntechnologies" password="passw0rd" roles="admin-gui, manager-gui" />
save it
<user username="Bhuvana" password="passw0rd" roles="admin-gui, manager-gui" />
admin-gui --> only access host-manager app
manager-gui --> access manager app and server status 



go to webapps/
/host-manager/
/META-INF
/vi context.xml, comment
<!-- valve claassname -->
give the same credentials what we saved in tomcat-users.xml



Tomcat-2
--------
Tomcat/Jboss/Wildfly/Jenkins --> Run in port 8080

Tomcat
conf
server.xml

soft links can help to start and stop the servers anywhere, that means any directory or user, normal user use sudo

cd /opt/apache-tomcat-9/conf/
vi server.xml, line 69 we can change port number and context path.

0-65535
0-1024 are reserved port numbers
HTTP: 80
HTTPS:8080
SSH : 22
SMTP : 25

from 1025 to 65535 we can use any port number
if we do nay changes in server.xml, restart the server
stopTomcat
startTomcat

vi /etc/ssh/sshd_config , change passwordAuthentication: yes
service sshd restart
passwd ec2-user, set password for ec2-user
passwd root-user set password
a passwd, Ip adress and password, is enough to connect any FTP tool or ssh tool,


open Filzilla, give public ip adress, password, port number 22 and drag and drop the files.

after upload the war file in Tomcat server
"we can check the war file in webappa directory "

for tomcat server
https://ipadress/maven-web-applcaiton/ is the context path

"we have stop option in the tomcat server, we can use the staop, start,  undeploy options based on requirements."



cp maven-web-applcaiton/ /tmp/ , copy the file to tmp directory

if we want to deploy the applcaiton through Deploy directory 

1) Contect path --> /mithuntechnologies 
2)Directory path --> /tmp/maven-web-applcaiton/ , where i copied my application

the name also will chnage on context path name, for ex: mithuntechnologies.war

if i select the war file which is available in my laptop downloads, by deploying that file, i can accees through two paths
!)/mithuntechnologies
2)/maven-web-applcaiton/

absolute path start from any of the directory for ex: /tmp/maven-web-applcaiton/ like that
relative path start from: Home/opt/apache-tomcat-9/webappas somrthing like that

cp /tmp/maven-web-applcaiton/ .(it represents cureetn directory)

cp war file to webapps directory is the deploying.

"check tomcat documents for further notes"



difference between appserver and webserver?
---------------------------------------------
APPSERVER                                WEBSERVER
---------                               ------------
WE CAN DEPLOY ONLY war.files            want to deploy ear files, use jboss, weblogic, websphere
App server used to deploy the          deploy the static content like HTML, csc,java script, images
backend code java 

it can process the business logic      it can be used to load balanceing purpose.
ex: username, password pages can        ex: Apche http server, Nginix server, IBM http server, these all are the Load Balancer webservers.
check and give permission

yum install httpd -y
enable:systemctl enable httpd
cd /var/www/html/ here create one file index.html
http://ip adress/mithun.html

yum install nginx -y

cd maven-web-applcaiton/
cd images
ls mithunlogo.jpg

cp mithunlogo.jpg /var/www/html/

then, cd /var/www/html/, ls -al, give permission, chmod u+x mithunlogo.jpg, chmod o+r mithunlogo.jpg

****************
what is conf file in HTTP?
httpd conf file
httpd.conf is the configuration file for HTTP SERVER

IT IS AVAILBALE IN /etc/httpd/logs directory


ELB is very important service in AWS

we can directly deply the "java" through "java -jar jarfilename"
