Nexus: 1
-------
Nexus is an open source Java based artifact repository.

Nexus is developed by using the Java, to install Nexus , first install the Java

it can used to store the Build artifacts,

Build Artifacts or Packages:
----------------------------
Build artifacts are the where we create dependencies

Java--> jar/war/ear
Nodjs --> Npm packages
Docker --> Docker images

based on the programming language artifacts are different.
Nexus can be used to store the build artifacts and retrieve the build artifacts whenever we required.
*******
Q)what is the difference between Nexus and Github?
Ans) Github we can store the source code, it is an scm, to manage the source code.
If we store artifacts packages in github repo, the retrieval method is very difficult.
*******
Apart form nexus we have another Artifact called"Jfrog"

The proider of Nexus is "Sonatype Nexus", Sonatype is a company name.


#Nexus Intallation:
-----------------

prerequisites:
--------------
Java
minimum 1GB RAM need to allocate it
minum 2 to 3 GB RAM for nexus, java
**********
Q)Is this possible to change the instance type once created?
Ans)Yes, stop the instance and change the instance type.

yum install java 1.8 .0-openjdk -y

yum remove java 1.8 .0-openjdk -y

Login as a root user
sudo su -
cd /opt
yum install tar wget -y
wget http://download.sonatype.com/nexus/3/nexus-3.15.2-01-unix.tar.gz
tar -zxvf nexus-3.15.2-01-unix.tar.gz
mv /opt/nexus-3.15.2-01 /opt/nexus

#As a good security practice, Nexus is not advised to run nexus service as a root user, so create a new user called nexus and grant sudo access to manage nexus services as follows.
 
useradd nexus

#Give the sudo access to nexus user

visudo
nexus ALL=(ALL) NOPASSWD: ALL

#Change the owner and group permissions to /opt/nexus and /opt/sonatype-work directories.

chown -R nexus:nexus /opt/nexus
chown -R nexus:nexus /opt/sonatype-work
chmod -R 775 /opt/nexus
chmod -R 775 /opt/sonatype-work

#Open /opt/nexus/bin/nexus.rc file and  uncomment run_as_user parameter and set as nexus user.

vi /opt/nexus/bin/nexus.rc
run_as_user="nexus"

#Create nexus as a service

ln -s /opt/nexus/bin/nexus /etc/init.d/nexus

#Switch as a nexus user and start the nexus service as follows.

sudo su - nexus

#Enable the nexus services

update the maven remote, proxy and, maven to host all urls in pom.xml, maven


when we doing bill, it will serach in Maven local
 maven Central repo
 then remote repo
 
 <dependency>
 <groupID>com.mss</groupId>
 <version>1.0.0</version>
 </dependency>
 
 <repositories>
<repository>
<id>nexus</id>
<url>
</repository>
</repositories>  exh opening tag should have a closing tag

name tag is not a mandatory

Blocked mirror error,

go to cd /opt/apache-maven-3.8.6/conf

vi settings.xml
there we can see mirror tag
<mirror>
<id>nexus</id>
<mirror>external:http:*</mirrorof>
<url>remote repo url</url>
remove the blocked
</mirror>

we have update this under <mirrors>

execute "mvn package"

in nexus server we are goin to create one "proxy repository"

give name proxy
mixed
we can select the central repo url which available in  remote storage


go to mirrors tag, update the proxy url at previous url place

cd ~/,m2/repository/
rm -rf log4j
rm -rf junit
mvn package

first time it will get from central repo
once the dependencies generate in proxy, it will go into the proxy for next time build "mvn package"


How to access the multiple repositories to get deendecoies?
Group the repositories

grouprepo-- name
under Member repositories
select the repositories name
cd ~/.m2/repository/
ls
cd com
rm -rf mss , if we delete thois will get error, because mail.jar file is not available, don't delete it

save the gprepourl, in pom.xml , under <repositories> tag

cd /apache-maven-3.8.x/conf

go to settings.xml, under <mirrors> tag remove the proxy url update the gprepourl
go to /projects/maven-web-applcation do the build, mvn clean package

"we can  use nexus, to create repositories and ll the images and push the images"
by  using docker (hosted)

***************

AS a devops engineers we are going to feate the repositories

create repos-- if any new projected is on boarded..

upload dependencies in remote repo.

***************

By using the repositories section, we can create different types of repositories based on the tool type.

Through blob store we can create storage in AWS in S3 --> simple storage services

select S3 OR FILENAME TO STORE THE PACKAGES IN BLOB STORE


clean up policies:
------------------
when keep on upload the packages , the hard disk will get fll or staorage problme,

through clean up we can automatically delete the old packages.

By clicking the repositories, we can choose the repository name which we want to clean  up, after create the clean up only, this will display in Repositories.

These apckages will store in S if we select the S option.

to give admin access, login with admin user,
go to server admin configuration 
change the nx.anonmos admin to other side


LADAP/ACTIVAE DIRECTORY AD
===========================
it conmtains all employee details, if we integrate LDAP with nexus, sonarqube,
we can able to login with jenkins, sonarqube, nexus server

how to configure LDAP with nexus
click on LDAP
AND give the details.

SSL certificates se within company not outside of company.

support:
--------
to check logs, status of memory
system information

defaulst admin credentials
usename:admin
password:admin123

click on admin and change the password and username 

check the status to see the changes.

system information:
-------------------
to know about nexus, edition, working dir, port nmbers, context path, java version...

Nexus is OSS, OPEN SOURCE
Nexus PRO, we have to pay money and purchase the license

sudo yum remove java -y

Tasks:
-----
to run the policies for every 24 hr, click on RUN in tasks.

API:
----
bY uSING THIS  nexusAPI, we can interact nexus server with programatically.


swagger is a one online documentation tool we can prive many options, just like nexus API, WE CAN TRY IT OUT.

IF WE WANT TO CALL THE api USE "CURL" COMMAND 

IF WE WANT TO Keep the commmnd in next line use  "\"

http://3.10.5.245:9000/----> this is old one in sonar. at nodejs date 25-10-22


Nexus is an opensourse
javabased, artifact repository
Nexus can be used to store the build articafts and retrive the build articafts

build artifacts/packages:
-------------------------
Java- jae/war.ear
Nodejs--> npm packages
Docker:Docker images

what is the diff between Nexus and Github?
Ans) Github is a scm , it used to manage the source code
retrivial methos is difficult in github

nexus is artifact repository

uSING DOWN LOAD THE DEPENDENCIES, LANGUAGES, 


snapshots are mutable, releases are immutable. This is why Nexus makes you store them separately because usually you don't care if you lose snapshots, but you will care if you lose releases

yum install java-1.8.0-openjdk -y
yum remove java-1.8.0-openjdk -y

wget https://download.sonatype.com/nexus/3/nexus-3.42.0-01-unix.tar.gz

4e7277e5-1bc1-4fc4-935a-ebf35c8bed80


to down load nexus latest version
to change the port number and context path use the file inside the /etc/, 'nexus-default.properties'

http://3.8.92.131:8081/


user name : admin
cat /opt/sonatype-work/nexus3/admin.password--> passwod in this location

"go to cd /opt/nexus/etc/"
 open vi 'nexus-default.properties' file and change te port number and path name
 i gave port number as 8081
 and path /nexus

 if we do any configuration changes in the nexus file have to restart the system.
 'sudo sytemctl restart nexus'
 
 
// comments 
 
 /nexus
 http://http://18.132.12.223:8081/nexus--> this is the port number and path which i saved in nexus file
 
 http://http://18.132.12.223:8081/
 
 
 restart the service: 'sudo systemctl restart nexus'
 http://http://18.132.12.223:8081/---> give with the path
 
 just go to nexus-default properties at etc directory, save and restart
 
 // comments
 
 change the port number nad path run the page
 

 http://http://18.132.12.223:8081/
 
 nexus repo after change the port number and path: nexus repository details is going to store in the 'pom.xml'
  -------------------------------------------------
 
 connect to maven server with mobaxterm
 change to root user
 go to 'cd projects/'
 ls
 go to 'cd maven-web -application'

go to 'pom.xml' , there give this below details(remeber everytime when you loging with aws the ip adress will chane , you can update the new ip addess url in maven pom.xml'

for nexus, we ae suing <distributionManagement>--> M should be uupercase

Nexus credentials:
is going to save in settings.xml
inside the conf we can see settings.xml

'cd /opt/apache-maven-3.8.6/conf/'

conf/
settings.xml
<server>
<id>nexus</id>
<username>admin</username>
<password>passw0rd</password>
</server>

id should be same in maven settings.xml and pom.xml , <id>nexus</id>
connect maven , open pom.xml, change the names and urls as nexus repository which we created

then go to cd /opt/apache-maven-3.8.6/conf/

update the urls 

open settings.xml--> update the server id and other details and save it 

'mvn clean deploy' run this command--> validate goal , test goal, package install then deploy goal it is going to execute

copy this link from nexus

to add this to some other project paste this dependency in pom.xml#
<dependency>
  <groupId>com.mt</groupId>
  <artifactId>maven-web-application</artifactId>
  <version>0.0.1-20221021.194000-1</version>
  <type>war</type>
</dependency>

in nexus , the data base will going to store in 'H2'

IN POM.XML, in this file at version tag shanpshot all files will download at snapshot/
if we just gave 


if we change the version number in pom.xml, it will decide where the files should download
<version>1.0.0</version>  the files will directly download in wall mart release
if we change the version as 0.0.1 the version, the files going to save in snapshot/ repository


if we execute 'mvn clean deploy', it won't work again, because it is immutable
but, if we chnage the version from 1.0.0. to 1.1.0 and execute the 'mvn clean deploy', it will work now work


again if we run 'mvn clean deploy' it shows error 400--> bad request

suppose if any updates need to do in 1.1.0 need to run again means --> go to nexus repo
select walmart-release/
select settings, conf
then go to deploy column, slect repdploy option, then run 'mvn clean deploy' in ur local server, it is going to run succesee


if we select allow redploy in wallmart-release/, it is going allow to deploy the same vresion

in nexus repository have to choose it.

now desible the redploy option in maven release, and save it, then 

execute 'mvn clean deploy'--> will get error

https://jar-download.com/artifacts/org.springframework.boot

To coonect with maven , create one remote repo in Nexus, take thwta urls

connect maven with mobaxterm
go to 'pom.xml'

update this 'remote url', name as 'nexus'

in depencies 

and update te same url and name in 'miirors'

and  go back to maven -web-application, run 'mvn clean package', the remote jar file will down load into central repo

dependecies are available in .m2 files
chenage the dependencies in pom.xml and settings.xml while connecting with 'proxy url'

suppose deleting dependecies in '.m2' folder
like junit, log4j files


down load the jar file 
and upload in remote repo


create remote repo at nexus
--------------------------------

<dependency>
  <groupId>com.software</groupId>

rOLE AND RESPONSIBILITIES
==============================
Nexus:
------
open source, Java based Artifactory repository

NEXUS CAN USED TO STORE THE BUILD ARTOFACTS AND RETRIVE THE BUILD ARTIFATCS


Build artifactor and packagaes both r same

build rtifacts for java, JAR,WAR,EAR
NODE JS Buildartifacts---> nopm packages

Docker--. Buildartifacts Dockerimages

What is the differenc eb/w Nexus anfd Github?
Ans) Github is SCM it can be used to manage the SOurce code.
Nexus is and artifactor reposiroty it can used to BUild packages 
it is provide by sonatype

Jfrog also is an artifcat repository, Jfrog is a company name

used to store the Artifacts, retrive the afrtifacts whenever we need

Nexus installation:
-------------------
Need to install Java

install each software in diffrent server

instance type: t2.medium

java 1.8 
yum install java-1.8.0-openjdk -y
wget https://download.sonatype.com/nexus/3/nexus-3.42.0-01-unix.tar.gz

tar -zxvf nexus-3.42.0-01unix.tar.gz

ls

cd nexus-3.42.0-01
pwd 
/opt/nexus-3.42.0-01 it is nexus home directory

cd /etc/

nexus-default.properties
here we can change the port number, and context path

rename:
------
mv nexus-3.42.0-01 nexus

useradd nexus

visudo " nexus ALL=(ALL)NOPASSWORD ALL"
chown -R nexus:nexus /opt/nexus
chown -R nexus:nexus /opt/sonatype-work
chmod -R 775 /opt/nexus
chmod -R 775 /opt/sonatype-work

vi /opt/nexus/bin/nexus.rc

#Create nexus as a service

ln -s /opt/nexus/bin/nexus /etc/init.d/nexus

#Enable the nexus services
sudo systemctl enable nexus

#Start the nexus service
sudo systemctl start nexus

8081/

CAT /OPT/SONAA-TYPE

COPY THE TOKEN

vi settings.xml
<servers>
<server>
<id>nexus</id>
<username>admin</username>
<password>admin123</password>
</server>
</servers>

in maven server execute

"mvn clean deploy"

sonartype, H2 is the defaukt data base which store the reports
Nexus also H2 is the default data base to store the reports

blob is a datattype in datatbase, we can store the large data bases

<version>0.0.1SNAPSHOT</version>
and realease the version "1.0.0."--> major version
f u want to do any changes n release , change the verson "1.1.0"--> minor version
"1.1.1"--> patch version
"f we allow redeploy, it is gong to upload with same version"

update this in pom.xml
under dependencies tag


<dependency>
<groupid>com</groupid>
<artifcatId>mail</artifactId>
<version>1.0.0</version>

</dependency>




if we remove the name "SNAPSHOT" IT IS going to upload in release

"snapshots are mutable , release are immutable. This is why nexus makes you store them separately, because usally you don't care

if you lose snapshots, but you will care if you lose releases."
