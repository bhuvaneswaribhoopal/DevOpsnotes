APPLICATION: Nothing but a piece of code

GIT IS SCM
SCM:SOURCE CODE MNAGEMENT

what is the difference between scm and artifcat repositories?
Ans)
scm is only for the source code
but packages we are going to maintain in nexus, Jfrog


28/11/22
Applications:
-------------
Application is solve somebusiness needs. 

standalone application ---> EX:Caliculator, which is installed locally rinnning in system
they are running locally, no need internet 


webapplicaiton ---> remote servers, 
 static applicaiton---> it is a fixed content, there is no interaction, no business logic, it is one way interaction, ex: wikipedia, new websites
 GUI with no business content
 fronT end technology: HTTP, CSS, JQUERY, JAVASCRIPT...
 
 
 Dynamic web applicaiton---> 3-TIER ARCHITECTURE, 
 
 3-tier arcthitecture
 
  presenation tier---> GUI graphical user interface
  applicaiton  tier (API)--->Applicaiton programming interface
  DATA tier --> data base, ex: sql, no sql base, document oriented database, oracle, my sql, postgre sql, sql servers
 UI--USER INTERFACE

************************************

EBS DEMO:
-------

ONCE Create the EBs Instance

then 
connect with linux
lsblk
sudo file -s /dev/xvdb
sudo mkfs -t ext4 /dev/xvdb create new file system

sudo mkdir /mynewvolume create a directory

sudo mount /dev/xvdb /mynewvolume

create a file inside the directory
once we reboot data witll be lost


for backup

so execute " sudo cp /etc/fstab /etc/fstab.orig"
ls /etc/ |grep "fstab"

sudo vim /etc/fstab

UUID=396a93cc-7908-4d47-9a52-44fda64d7663    /var/lib/jenkins   ext4    defaults,nofail        0       2

make the above entry in that file

 to unmount the data execute the below command
"sudo umount /var/lib/jenkins"
sudo blkid

lsblk

sudo mount -a, change to the /myvolume and execute this command
*******************************************
UUID=396a93cc-7908-4d47-9a52-44fda64d7663

UUID=8771a838-46e3-4508-aabf-549b5db42fe3

SAVE THE ABOVE ID IN "/ETC/FSTAB" FILE

if we get permission denied at any point change the owner of the server--

"sudo ls -lar /var/lib/jenkins/"

"sudo service jenkins start"
"sudo service jenkins status"

" sudo netstat -tunlp "

once change the volume in instance execute below command
" sudo resize2fs /dev/xvdf"

df -kh


lifecycle management
using this we can creation, retain, de;lete as well as amis also

as per the policy AWS will document



migration

means the data will copy to one server to another server region

i can taje a snapshort and from that snapshort i can create a volume and create one ec2 to that particular instance to where i want to move

to that instance i can attach that volume

goldenimage:
-------------
My AMI , whcihh we create for our own with required software, it is called goldenimage


sudo file -s /dev/xvdb

sudo mount /dev/xvdb /var/lib/jenkins

snapshort 
backup --> restore
migrate

we can take sql back up 

like /var/lib/sql
same like jenkins

instance back up if i select immage, it will take snapshort of root volume and additional volume

create AMI is different , instance backup is different


provisioned IOPS io2(supports multi attached EBS volumes)


throughput data can transfer MB/SEC

ssd data trasfter IOps

EFS: -->ELASTIC FILE SYSTME NFS PROTOCOL
---
fsx --> IT'S FILE STORE FOR WINDOWS ( SMB) protocol both are NAS





" for example IF WE WANT TO START THE JENKINS, U CAN;T START THE JENKINS AS ROOT USER
SO CHANGE THE OWNER
CHOWN -R jenkins:jenkins -R /myvolume

if it is jenkins file or someother please use some other name instaed of jenkins

Statefile will maintain in Local,instead of using local backend for terraform state file, stored in remotebackend s3 bucket, 

s3 is a global Resource. You can access data from anywhere.

How many s3 buckets can create in one AWS accoint by default?
100 s3 buckets (Adjustable-yes)
what is max file size in s3 which you can upload/store?

5TB single file
5000gb (it is not adjustable), hard limit

you no need to mount s3 to any server to upload/access objects(data)

with your mounting you upload /download/access objects from s3.

using GUI (aws console), API, SDK(software development kit, like boto, boto3), CLI.


AWS s3 ls

aws s3 mb s3://testbucket23
aws s3 cp test.txt s3://tesbucket23/test.txt
aws s3 cp  s3://tesbucket23/test.txt test.txt

from GUi there is only 165 gb is allowed not moe than that

403 is forbidden
404 page not found
401 unathuorized
400 bad request


s3 security:
-----------
Public access
ACL--> Access control List (legacy)
Bucket policies

if we want to make it public enable the ACL policy, so everyone can access, but it is not good practise, AWS it self mentioning,

BUCKET POLICIES ARE IN THE FORM OF JASON

WHAT IS ARN: AMAZON RESOURCE NAME, it is a unniue way to identify any AWS resources

arn:aws:s3::::bhuvanabuckets3demo/* here * for all the objects

here AZ and region are optional

* represents ananymous access

action is nothing but permission, in jason format s3 bucket


AWS -11  s3 versioning
--------
s3 versioning:
--------------

In s3 if we enable the VERSIONING  and upload the file, previous versions of the files also maintain by S3
that means, if i upload a file , and did some changes in file and again upload, the bith files i can see in s3 only if i enbla eth everison

if i didn't enable the vreiosning , i upload a file, and later if i do any changes and again if i upload the file, the new file is going to override on the old file , like how we save the files in system.


charges in s3:
--------------
charges is based on the size of the object or data, and based on the storage class, in which we are manning or storing.
and also the availablity and durablity of the data.

BY DEFAULT S3 MAINTAINT THE DATA IN "STANDARD"
Advantages are the performance . data is highly available, but frequently acceesibile, quickly retrivabla


for ex:
storage classess:
---------------- 
standard storage
standard IA (IN FREQUENT ACCESS)
one zone IA 
RRS
Glacier: Archival DATA means backup or historical data, maintain the old data in glacier with low cost but, while retrieving charges are bit high

instant glacier , are the cheapest storage in s3
deep glacier

RRS: Reduced Reduncy STORAGE, there is a possiblity to lose the DATA

Non-critical, Repoducable data only allowed to main in RRS

standard storage:
------------------
standarad:  --> quickly or Frequently acceeble DATA and highly available but charges are bit high.Az is 3
IA --> THE data whoch is not accessing frequently, we can maintain in IA, under this IA
STANDARD IA --> CHARGES LESS, multiplr AZ, retrieving is little less.
ONEZONE IA --> one copy of data one AZ




Always default is STANDARD STORAGE


RRS: Reduced Reduncy STORAGE --> there is a possiblity to lost the DATA
----
99.999999999% highly availbale S3 SLA

ONLY Non-critical REPRODUCABLE Data is only allowed to maintain in RRR
(REPRODUCABLE Means eventhough we lost we can reproduce again.)
Az is 3

Glacier: is  a archival or retrival data
-------
For security purpose we need to maintain last 5 or 10 yrs dATA, WE CAN MAINTAIN IN THE gLACIER WITH LOW COST.

BuT WHEN WE accessing the data, charges are bit high, and retrival time also taken bit latency
Az is 3

s3 bucket can acceble from same account same region, same account different region.

ReplicationRule: s3 bucket can acceble from 
----------------
Same account same region
Same account diff region
Different account same region
dIFF ACCOUNT DIFF REGION

SYNCHORNUS COpying immediately
Asynchrnous not copying immediately


"snowball is a divice physical transfer the data, they copy the datat and move the datat to s3 .





example of s3 datamaintains:
--------------------------
First 30 days the data will be in standard
After 30 days of object certain it has to be in RRS or IA or gLACIER 
After 360 days Object has to be deleted from s3

it calls as  a "Object life cycle"

VPC--> networking
Subnet---> eVERY SUBNET HAVE ITS OWN ROUTER, 
IGW --> INternet gate way which is virtual router enable the internet connectivity, one vpc attached to one IGW

NACL
VPC Peering

tYPES OF Networks
LAN --> Local area network
MAN ---> Metropolitan Network
WAN --> Wide Area NETWORK
PAN--> Personal Area NETWORK

vpc creating for our own is called custom VPC

VPC is a network creating in your local aws console

SUBNET IS A BREAK OF BIG NTWORK INTO SMALL GP OF NETEORK

1)public subnet --> access to the or route to internet call public subnet
2)private Subnet ---> doesn't have accee or don't have route to the internet called private subnet, only reach within the network, not outside, it is secure


while creating a VPC we should define the network /IP range IN THE FORM OF CIDR

Class Less Interdomain Routing. It's method for allocting IP adress and it's routing for ptivate networks.

172.16.0.0 --> 172.31.255.255
192.168.0.0 ----> 192.168.255.255   THESE ALL ARE PRIVATE IP RANGES

THESE ONLY RESERVED FOR INTERNAL HOST


EACH VPC have 3 subnets in multiple AZ, if we create all subnets under one AZ , in natural disaster it is not recommended.


there are 2 type of subnets:
---------------------------
public subnet has route to the internet
private subnet there is no route to the internet, it is called intranet


How to create own vpc and connect with internet:
-----------------------------------------------
click on my own vpc, create one new vpc

clikc on subnets in different availability zones , use sunbet calculator to divide subnet

main vpc between the range of 172.16.0.0 --> 172.31.255.255

choose something like 172.16.0.0/25
                                32-n   32-25
always follow the formula      2     = 2

go to route tabel and create own routable , go to vpc click on edit vpc, slect, enable DNS actions

go to subnets click on edit subnet actions enable "Enable auto-assign public IPv4 address"

" select route under subnet edit the boud rule add new rule with all port number allowed , like . 0.0.0.0/0 and save

go to route table create one new route table, select my own vpc(which i created)
create IGW in internet gatway, attach that internet gate to "my vpc", and go to route table, select the subnets, what we are created from new vpc

click on route, add, 0.0.0.0/0 and select gateway, then oue new igw id will display which we connected with myVPC, CONNECTE TO THAT AND SAVE


under route table, select, route, add inbound rule, to allow intranet connection
under route table , select, subnet associtaion, add subnets whatever we create our own under vpc with different AZ , add that all subnets under "route"

create one NEWINSTANCE, take the public IP AND OPEN THE SERVER IN MOBAXTE

curl -v telnet://private ip
NAT: NETWORK ADRESS TRANSLATE

bY adding the NAT ROUTE in ROUTE table where we can access to the private subnets, private servers talk to the NAT and nat will talk to the INternet

"create NAT in public subnet, then private subnet contact NAT and NAT contact internet"

NACL --> Network access controll List
what is difference b/w NACL & SG ?
sg -> fire wall at instance server level
IT;S A SATEFUL
IT SUPPORTS ALLOW RULES, BY DEFAULT BEHAVIOUS IS DENIED OF ALL THE RULES

NACL --> IT'S A FIREWALL AT SUBNET LEVEL
IT'S  A STATELESS
IT SUPPORT ALLOW RULES AS WELL AS DENY RULES
IT IS ONE MORE LEVEL OF SECURITY

NAT :
-------

NAT--> network adress traslator, By creating a NAT gateway, private subnets can talk to internet, this is only one way connection.

create NAT in public subnets.
(NAT gate way IP adress 192.168.0.21)
create separate route table for NAT. AND ADD THE PRIVATE SUBNETS IN THAT ROUTE TABLE


Private subnets, don't have internet activity, they have only local connection, in between the subnets, by creating NAT in it can talk to internet.

AWS have some API'S to upload, down load the files in S bucket.

in VPC peering open the port icpm 

DEVELOPMENT HAS ONE VPC
OPERATIONS HAS ONE VPC
QA HAS ONE VPC

IF THEY WANT TO CONNECT EACH DEPARTMENT WE WILL CREATE "VPC PEERING"

FOR PIING NEED TO OPEN THE POTOCOL LIKE !icmp! for all th esources
-------------------------------------
NACL: NETWORK ACCESS CONTROLL LIST:
-------------------------------------
Security gp is a fire wall at instance level. It can allow network traffic, all the port are open in otbound rules, not inbond rules, we ahve to opne the port for inbound traffic.

SG : is a fire wall at instance or server level, it is stateful, whatever the port we are allowing , it allows the reposnse both inbond and outbound.
It spports allow rules.By default everything is denied only.


NACL is alos a fire wall,at subnet level. It is a stateless, if we open port in inbound , explicitly we have to opne that port in outbound also.
It supports allow rles and deny rules.

NACL is a one mor elevel of security.


vpc peering:
--------------
Requester VPC--
Accepter VPC

WE CAN vpc PEERING B/W two different VPCs

Those vpcs in same account same region
Those vpcs in same account different region
Those vpcs in different account same region
Those vpcs in different account different region



Load balancer: is a process distribute the load among the servers.
--------------
In production environmaent will deploy same applicaiton in multiple servers, for high availablity , like bank, online orders..



software load balancers:
-----------------------------

Nginx
Apachehttpd
haproxy

HardwareLB:
----------
Citrix
F5

"HYPERVISOR IS USED FOR INSTANCE CREATE A VIRTUAL MISSIONS TO DO THE VIRUALIZATION"

due to network scurity, we access the applicaiton through proxy urls

end users are from internet that mans public network, i have the LB in public network, i can create LB with public IP, request goes to LB,

"LB and applcaiiton are same networks, "

"subnets for environment are different are all the environments under same network, it can work internally connect internally"



osi layers: open system interconnection describes 7 layers
one system can talk to another system through network

WHAT IS NETWORK LB AND APPLCAITON LB?
"LAYAER 4 NETWORK LB blindly send the request to some server and some port", LESS LATENCY, HANDING MILLIONS OF REUESTS PER SECOND
IT SUPPORTS TCP/UDP

"Layer7 IS ApplIcatIon LB send the request send and it operates at the request level, host based routing, path based routing like that "
IT SUPPORTS HTTP/HTTPS PROTOCOLS

ELB:
             80  443
NETWORK LB (TCP/TLS ---> Layer 4)
                80   443
applcaiton LB (HTTP/HTTPS ---> LAYER 7)

CLASSIC IS LEGACY(OLD), IT SUPPORTS BOTH LAYER 4 AND 7 N AND A


ELB Listeners:
--------------
ELB should have atleast one listerner

ex: tcp --> 80, INSECURE GOES TO 80

tlc --> 443, SECURE GOES TO 443, USE PORT ALSO ALONG WITH IP ADRESS OR DOMAIN

we can add upto 50 listerners, 

Target groups:
---------------
TCP 80 ---> FORWARD REQUEST TO SOME TARGET GP

IT'S LOGICAL GP OF THE TARGET BEHIND THE LB

"SINGLE TARGET GP CONTAINS UPTO 1000 SERVERS ALSO WE CAN ADD"


each LB WILL HAVE ATLEAST ONE LISTENER LIKE PORTNUMBER 80

HEALTH CHECKS ALLOW traffic to shifted to the another servers. ELB perfomrance health checks, shfited the traffics from failure instances, something went wrong, network issue, server down, LB stop to send the traffic to that server.


ELB HAS LISTERNS, 
LISTERNERS HAS ROUTING RULES
ELB DO THE HEALTH CHECKS ALSO,

Interview qestion:
-----------------
ELB is a regional service. ELB distribte application reqest to mltiple targetss(services(EC2)) those can in 
different AZ bt in a same region
