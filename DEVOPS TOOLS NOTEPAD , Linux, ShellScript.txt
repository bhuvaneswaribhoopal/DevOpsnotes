DEVOPS FIRST TOOL
==================
Linux commands
ShellScripting


GITHUB
GIT and GITHUB both are not same

In work to share the codes inbetween the colliques
to need communicate

GitHub Administration
---------------------

communicator Examples
----------------------
MS teams
slack
skype for business
Lync

we should not share the source code by using emails or communicator

Only can share the source code by using centralized remote tripositry

SCM--> SOURCE CODE MANAGEMENT
GitHub--> open source
GitLab
BitBucket

TFS--> TEAM FOUNDATION SERVER
CVS--> CONCURRENT VERSION SYSTEM
SVN--> SUBVERSION

Repo--->Repository

http://github.com

GitHub Enterprise Edition(for company purpose , we need to pay to GitHub)

https://ghe.mss.com
https://aa.ghe.com

bhuvi-devops-course
1) create an organisation:

https://github.com/bhuvi-devops-course

2)Create the repository

https://github.com/bhuvi-devops-course/mithunITcourses.git
https://github.com/bhuvi-devops-course/Devopscourse2022Team.git

ssh URL:git@github.com:bhuvi-devops-course/mithunITcourses.git

3)create a new team:
-------------------
team name:Devopscourse
https://github.com/orgs/bhuvi-devops-course/teams/devopscourse2022


4)Add the users to the team

go to the team which we creadted click on the team name and add memenber
by default the memeber who create the team is going to be add as memeber

click on the add memeber and add memebers 


5)provide repository access to the team:

click on repository add the repository name to the repository then the access will enable to team memebers
 who are all added into team
 
 change the repository private to pubilc at dangerzone by clicking the change visisbility
 
 
 ONCE YOU DELETE THE TEAM OR ORGANISATION WE CANNOT RECOVER IT BACK
 
 Q2. hOW TO CREATE PARENT TEAM FOR ONE REPOSITORY AND EXPLAIN ONE USE CASE?
 
 Q3. How tp delete parent team/child team from repository?
 
 

we are not creating repository on our username only using the repository on organisation name



create an organisation
creat on repo
create TEAM
https://github.com/orgs/bhuvi-devops-course/teams/devopscourse2022
GIT COMMANDS--> DATE 28/9/2022

Linux:
------
mkdir -v devops.txt
here v means verbose

mkdir -pv DevOps/Linux/ShellScript/Git/Maven/Tomcat/Sonarqube

p mean parent

ls -ltr
l means long list, t means access time, r means reverse

inode:
-------
Inode is datastructure it store the information like permission, size, no. of links, groups, timestamp..

but it won't show file name and dir name
ls -li to get inode number

/root --> it is root user home directory

/etc ---> absoulte path start from root directory
cd etc ---> relative path start from current directory


current directory file serach
find . -type f -empty to find empty files

find . -type d -empty to find directories

find . -i filename

chmod -R ( if we ae not use -R the permissions only goig to change for the parent directory)

not to subdiretories, if we use -R permission chnage to parent and sub directories

"chmod u+rwx,go+rw filename"
"chmod ugo+rwx filename"  (u is user, g is group , o is others)
"chmod ugo-rwx filename" to remove permissions


*************
cat filename | grep web-server (it will give web-server name inside the file)

who -H (heading)

whoami --> it give the current user name
user --> this command give details of all users whoever connected 
whereis ls ---> it give all of binary file details

hostname -i

change to root user and execute the command
"hostname bhuvana"

'systemctl list-units-file ' it wil display all services list


ps -ef | grep jenkins (to get process id)

PID

kill -9 PID(THERE 1-64 SIGNALS)

kill -l 


Linux---> Manage the linux commands
Shellscripr-->to do the automation
git and github--->develope the code manage the source code
maven-->build tool, creating the packages
Tomcat--->deploy the applicaitons, packages

Sonarqube--->code quality management tool, to check the quality of code
it is a static code analasis tool, 
Senior developers do the code review

peer to peer code review
code coverage:
--------------
How many lines of code is tested by unit test cASES

code review:
------------
Validating line by line code and checking the weather code is following all the standards or not


Java--> Jnuit testing frame work will use
.net--> Nunit
c--> cunit
c++---> cppunit
Python--> Pytest


SonaQube version: 9.x


sonarqube/Nexus/Jenkins --> developed by Java, it will support multi language
Maven/Ant/Gradle/Tomcat/was(webapplicaiton server)/Weblogic--. > developed by Java only support Java

mYsql
postgreysql  are opensource, no need to pay the money

Exceptional handling Mechanism:
------------------------------
try{here keep the code, which many gives the errors}
catch
finally
throw
throws

"sonarqube server is a code quality management tool, which can be used to check the quality of the source code"
it supports 20+ languages
C++, VISUAL BASIC,.NET, COBOL ABAP


FREE FOR: PUPPET, GROOVY, JAVA SCRIPT, JAVA PYTHON, XML, 




interview question? what is load average
"load average represents that what is  CPU utilization, it will 3 values, 1min interval time, 5 th minute interval time, 15th minute interval time
 "
first git clone git nodej.s scm

yum install npm

yum install nodejs -y

npm run sonar

"npm install" execute to donload the packages

 
****************  7/12/22
"cpuinfo" in proc directory

PREREQITE SOFTWARES:
--------------------
java- 11
sonarqube 9.x

along with sonarqube H2 data bese will be there

it needs 2 GB RAM, run in java 11

sonaqub run with 9000 port number

***********************
Linux:5 video
--------------
vim editor or vi editor
:se nu
:se 108
:se nonu means no numbers
/load  it means to search the word

crl+o for saving
ctrl+x for closing

yum install nano -y

cat -n  this command display the all content with numbers
"head filename" by default it is going to display the first 10 lines

"head -n 12 filename" to display first 12 lines
"tail -n 20 filename " it display last 20 lines

"sed -n "90,98p" filename"

"sed -n "90p" filename" print only line number 90

"less filename"

"cat filename | sort


sort -r filename" this will display the content in everse order

"cat filename | sort | tr [a-z] [A-Z]"  THIS COMMAND TO CHANGELOWER CASE TO UPPERCASE

grep to serach the particular word 

ex: cat filename | grep workkspace(word)

grep -i work filename  it helps to neglect the case 


"sed "s/red/blue/" sample.txt"

the above command helps to change the work wjerever red it change to blue/

"sed "s/red/blue/g" sample.txt" here g is globally it replace all the places

sed mean speed editor, it is gping to work on the editor

"sed -i "s/red/blue/g" sample.txt", if wee use i it will update and create the file also 


Linux-6:
-------

"who" command will give the information about username

who -H WILL GIVE EXTRA INFO, ip , user
                                                                                            1min 5 min 15 min 
"W" command will give info about login user, and load average represents cpu utilising 0.00 0.00 0.00


"uptime " will give th eserver run time load avg and more

"users" tis will give all user info

"cpuinfo" there we can see the cpu information

"cat /proc/cpuinfo"
" whereis ls" to serach the file or dir name where available

"man mkdir" it helps to give more info about mkdir

"timedatectl" it gives the timezone details

"df" disk free

"df -h" to get human readabale format

"du" disk usage

"du -h" 
"du -h directoryname"
"du -sh directoryname"

"hostname"  ip adress, if we want t change the hostname

"hostname bhuvana", switch to root user and change the name


"ifconfig". switch to root user and and install net-tools for ifconfig

serach package name in google so that we can get the package name

"yum install net-tools -y" , to get ifconfig 

"ipconfig"
"hostname -i" will give ht eipadress

"man date"
"man hostname"
man will give detailsinformation about command

"mkdir --help", we can use help for any command

"whatis ls" if will give short infrmation

"service or systemctl"

services.msc

"service sshd status"

service as option (status|start|stop|restart)

systemctl ssh status

"last" command will give the user login details

 Linux 7:
 -------
'ps'
ps -ef | grep jenkins
ps -ef | grep java
PID
kill -9 PID

THERE ARE 1-64 SIGNAL TYPES ARE THERE

"top" command memory utilization, monitoring utility

display Linux tasks

"zip" 
"zip -r devops.zip Devops"
for etracting we r using the UNZIP command

"unzip devops.zip" it will extend the Directory, so delete the previous directry

tar -cvf devops.tar -d /tmp/

tar -zcvf devops.tar.gz
tar -zxvf devops.tar.gz


shadow
"/etc/ shadow"
"passwd bhuvana"

"cat /etc/ shadow"
if unzip command not found, "yum install unzip -y"

"passwd ec2-user"
"cat /etc/ shadow"


"passwd root"
"cat /etc/ shadow"

to set attributes  means to set the password minimum working days

here the -1 is infinite

"usermod -g groupname(devops) bhuvana"
lid -g devops(gp name)

"id bhuvana" it will set the id and set the gp

"usermod -L bhuvana" to lock the user
"usermod -U bhuvana" to unlock the user


Normal user to normal user we have t gve password
Normal user to rootuser need to give password


visudo

"bhaskar ALL=(ALL) ALL"  TO SAVE IN THE VISUDO FILE , WHATERVER THE ROOT HAVE THE AUTHORITIE bhuvana USER ALSO WILL GET


IF WE WANT TO SWITCH THE USER
"sudo passwd harsha"

"sudo groupadd dba"
"cat /etc/group"
"sudo groupdel dba"

"sudo userdel bhuvana"
"touch filename"

Linux -8
---------
crontab: Automating /Scheduling Tasks commands
--------
sudo touch /etc/cron.allow it will work only in root user 

crontab -l displat how many jobs configured
crontab -e to editor
crontab -r to remove

without execute permissions we cannot run the command

"chmod u+x filename"  to give execute permissions run this command

wat is crontab format?
there are total of 6 fields

first fields minutes 0-59
2nd field Hour 0-23
3rd field Day of month 1-31
4th field month 1-12 or jan-Dec 
5th field day of week 0-6 or sun-sat
6th field command/script (/usr/bin/find) give the absolute path

/1 * * * * /home/ec2-user/hello.sh > home/ec2-user/hello.log

https://crontab-generator.org

crond.service will monitor the running jobs

> :redirect std o/put
>> : append std o/put

File Description:
-------------------
0--> std i/p
1--> std o/put
2--> std error
*/1 * * * * /home/ec2-user/hello.sh > home/ec2-user/hello.log 2>&1
1 9 1 * * home/ec2-user/hello.sh >/dev/null 2>&1

create file hello.sh
chmod u+x hello.sh


crontab -e 
*/1 * * * * /home/ec2-user/hello.sh > home/ec2-user/hello.log 2>&1
if we mention "/30 every 30 minutes one it is going to run



ls

crontab -l

cat hello.log

before deleting it self we have to take the backup 


Linux-9
--------
set the password for ec2-user, Bhuvana, root
restart sshd.service

vi /etc/ssh/sshd_config

passwordAuthentication yes
service sshd restart
restart sshd.service

ssh ec2-user@18.134.142.152 and it will ask ec2-user password give "passw0rd"

it will start 

follow linux videos


" if we want to connect without pem file, enabke the service password aunthentication in sshd_config file as "yes" , 
then ssh ec2-user@ipadress , it will connect to the server
before set the passwordds for ec2-user, root and Bhuvana(if we created)

scp: secure copy
-----------------
scp filename ec2-user@ip/hostname:/tmp/ (anyof the user copy to tmp directory)
scp -r directoryname ec2-user@ip/hostname:/tmp/
scp -r Python/ ec2-18-134-142-152.eu-west-2.compute.amazonaws.com:/tmp/

scp is secure copy
FTP is not secure copy
WINSCP ONLY SUPPORT FOR WINDOWS

FILEZILLA will support in windows and macbook both , it is also a tool to copy the files and directories


scp directoryname ec2-user@ec2-18-134-142-152.eu-west-2.compute.amazonaws.com:~ or /tmp/
bY using the "scp" command copy the the files and directories form one server to another server

Harshada2806

set the password to serverB
ec2-user passwd set
open sshd_config , passwordauthentication YES
service sshd restart
restart sshd.service


error: no support authentication methods avaialble 

for this error first need to connect the server in linux and enablethe passwordauthentication yes


"df -h " will show disk utilization
top
free display RAM size

free -h human readable format
free -k, -m, -g

dmidecode  execute this command as root user
this command wil give RAM details
Clod servers: Maintain by comapnies like, AWS, AZURE, GCP, IBM...
onpremesis server : physically existed in your comapanies

BASED ON THE ENVIRONAMENT WE ARE USING DIFFERENT RAM SIZE

Development environment 

mail command
install related mail command packages
configure SMTP server with linux server, 

SMTP: Simple main trasfer protocol, linux admin will configure this server in our systemctl
mail emailid: emailid : email id

suject
email body

ctrl D


Linux-10
--------

cls --> work in windows
clear --> work in Linux

cal command will display the month
cal -1 
cal -3 diaply last, current , next month
cal 1985
cal 1 1985 to display month of the year


if we want to dowload any software

goto new window, serach for the software , copy the links

then come to linux
"wget -o /tmp/maven.zip link" -o will and specify the name instead of name in the link it will save the name what we given next t -o
yum install wget" before execute the above command, as root user

curl and wget are same commands to download the software
but
curl can have advance features, mainly it helps to call the API'
it helps to many protocaols

wget simply download the softwares

curl command supports multiple protocol

API: Appliction programmning interface


ls > lsopt.txt, redirect the files to this particualr file

ls | tee teeopt.txt , output display and content also is availbale 

cat teeopt.txt

the commands out put will store in "typecsript"

exit from the script
then type "cat typescript"

instead of script name we can give customname means anyfile name 

like : script bhuvana.txt
ping google.com
ping -c 4 google.com

port is an entry point into server

for servefr 0-1023 --> reserverd ports

0-65535 total ports

ssh --> 22
HTTP--> 80
HTTPS ---> 443
SMTP -25
FTP--> 23
telnet --> 21


telent google.com 80

sudo yum install telnet -y

telnet will dis[play that port is enable or not
ping will ping and see the services and connectivity

telent we can check the connectivity wheather port is enable or not
"history -c"

each user has his own history

whcih operating sytem we are using execute "uname"

to know which distribution we are using 

/etc/redhat-release

ubuntu
/etc/os-release

cat /etc/*release  anyfile with extention release
this command helps to know the distribution details

"netstat", which id which tool which port it is using

"netstat -tunlap" (tcp portocal), 7 layers are there, trasport, physical, applciaiton, isos layers
whcih port is using which port


"watch" by using watch command we can monitor any particular service we required freequently
watch date
watch -n 5 date

shutdown

shutdown -c to stop the shutdown


Shell scripting:
-------------------
what is shell?
Ans) Shell is a progrma , it will takes the commands whatever user has typed and it will gives the OS to execute.

Shell is an interface between user and OS.


WHAT IS THE path for the FILE NAME OF SHELLS?

cat /etc/shells

shell types:
------------
sh --> available in all older versions
bash ---> default in all advanced Linux servers
csh
KSH--> provided by IBM, with server AIX
tcsh

to install any of the shell which is not in server , use yum install csh for example

to know present working directory of shell
"echo $SHELL" , IF WE DIDN'T MENTION $ SYMBOL IT IS GOOING TO TAKE AS USUAL


bash shell scripting 
Linux commands --> Linux server

Power shell
DOS commands --> windows

what are the shellscripts u written in your company?
serverresourcemonitor.sh

top
df -h
free -h
THRESOLD=80

mail
hostname
ifconfig

dbbackup.sh
it is going to take the database backup
RDMS
ORACLE MYSQL, POSTGREYSQL, ms SQL SERVER, DB2, BIG DATA
NO SQL OR MONGODB

DATA IS NOT GOING TO STORE IN THE TABLES, IN A JASON FORMAT IT WILL STORE

TO STORE THE DATA WE ARE GOING TO USE THIS RDMS RATIONAL DATABASE MANAGEMENT SERVICE

i write a shell script, work with DBA guy, he configure some sql queries, then we set into the CRONTAB 

don't touch nay files except the /tmp/ directry, becuase in /tmp/ there are temporary files, even if u delete not impact much 

shell script run on Linux/Unix/AIX server


#!/bin/bash --> shebang line

before run the shellscript file, give execute permissions to the file
chmod 644 or chmod u+x , to execute the permissions



shellsript2:
-------------
How many ways there to run the shell script
./filename
sh filename.sh
bash filename.sh
csh filename.sh
tcsh filename.sh


How to know how amny shells in server 

cat /etc/shells

shebang line represents thats ,which shell we needs to execute this command


what is the command to run the shellscript as debug mode?
sh -x filename.sh

if we want to execute only one line in debug mode 
use 
set -x
echo "goodmoening"
st +x

line by line we can see out put so that we know , which command gives the error

file name should start only alphabets only, 

comments:
----------
why we r using comments?
it is mpre readabaleand understanable of the code.

identifies the errors, and understand the code

c/c++/java/terraform/Groovyscript

single line comments //

multiline comments
/*
..
..
..
..
*/
shellscript comments:
----------------------
# ---> single line comments
<< Bhuvana --> multiline comments , give any text
...
...
Bhuvana
then it will ignore the lines between these

what is shell script?
shellscript is simple file, which contains some set of commands


cat -n filename.sh , it open the file with numbers

varibale:
---------
it is memory location where we can store the values
two types of variables
a)system defined variables
B)user defined variables

what are command we are going to use to display the system defines variables?
env or printenv commands to diaply the systemdefined variables

varibalename
SHELL=/bin/bash
       variable value
Histsize 1000, if it reaches to 1001, the first command is going to be delete

echo $HISTSIZE
echo $SHELL

IF WE WANT TO USE THE COMMANDS AS VARIBALE IN SHELL SCRIPT EXCUTE ALL IN CAPITALLETTERS WITH $SYMBOLS

EX: echo $USER

echo $HISTORY

increase or decrease the hstory size, use this command,export HISTZISE=200, IT HELPS TO CHANGE THE HISTZISE

.bash_profile add export HISTSIZE=200, it is going to be permanent

userdefines varibles:
---------------------
we are going to create this inside the shellscript

ex: int a=10, int b=20 String Name="software solutions"


shell script:

a=10
b=20
name=software solutions
echo $a
echo $b
echo $name

a=10
b=20
name=software solutions
echo "display the value of a is" $a
echo "display the value of b is" $b
echo "display the name of varibale " $name


a=10
b=20
name=software solutions
a=40
echo $a
echo $b
echo $nam

it is gooing to take last value



a=10
b=20
name=software solutions
echo "display the value of a is" $a
echo "display the value of b is" $b
echo "display the name of varibale " $name
echo "The user name is" $USER
hsize=$HISTSIZE
echo "The user name is" hsize


SHELLSCRIPT-3:
-----------------

COMMAND LINE ARGUMENTS:
----------------------
echo $0 ---> script name
echo $1 --> 1st arg value
echo $2 --> 2nd arg value
echo $3 --> 3rd arg value

echo ${11} --> from 11th arg value
echo $# ---> number of args

echo $* --> give all the arguments

echo$@ ---> all the arguments

what is the difference b/t $* and $@ ?
$* --> all the arg a one string --> "proddb dbloc"
$@ --> each arg as a one string ----> "proddb" "dbloc"

echo $$ --> PID
date
echo $? --> previous command execution status

127 --> standard error for  "command not found"

vi dbbackup.sh

command line arguments are very important follow the below:
------------------------------
echo "C L Args demo"
echo $0
echo $1
echo $2
echo $3
echo ${11}
echo $#
echo $*
echo $@
echo $$
date
echo $?

sh dbbackup.sh  dbname dbbloc

if the user pass 2 arg , then we need to execute
otherwise
display one user fndly msg

if [$# -eq 2]
then
--
--
--
else
--
--
fi

shellscript for if else condition:
---------------------------------
if [$# -eq 2]
echo "C L Args demo"
echo $0
echo $1
echo $2
echo $3
echo ${11}
echo $#
echo $*
echo $@
echo $$
date
echo $?
else
echo "please pass the 2 arg"
echo "usage: sh $0 dname dbloc"
fi
file name : vi ifelsecond.sh
run the above

to pass 2 arg run the script like sh ifelsecond.sh dbname dbloc

the difference b/w = and == ?
= --> Asiign the value
== --> comparision 
-eq ---> ==
-ne --> != not equal

-le --> <= less than
=lt --> <
-ge --> >= greater than
-gt ---> >


write a shell scrpt to install java if java not installed

if it is installed display a user frndly msg java laready installed

echo "Checking Java has installed or not"
java -version
if [$? -eq 0]
then
echo "Java has already installed.."
else
echo "Java has not installed.."
echo "Install java"
sudo yum install java-11-openjdk -y if we executing as ec2-user execute with sudo
fi

Nginx installation
-------------------
echo " checking nginx installation"
nginx -version

if [$? -eq 0]
then
echo "niginx not installed"
else
yum -y install wget
echo "dnf install https://dl.fedoraproject.org/pub/epel/epel-release-latest-8.noarch.rpm"
yum install nginx
systemctl enable nginx.service
systemctl start nginx.service
echo " check nginx version"
nginx -version
fi


#Tomcat installation
======================
sudo yum install java-11-openjdk -y

will add the parameter called weight=5 , 5 requ go to that particular server and i request go to other service, 

if one server has 512mg RAM, 100 cpu, other server has 32gb, 8 core cpu,  

we are hiding all tagetting server, we are proxying the server ips to nginx ip adress and using that url for end user usage

***********
How the end users will access the applicaiton?
Ans) If we create a DNS, that domain will reach the proxy url, reuest go to that IP 80, from there request forwardded to respect ports

shellscript -4:
----------------

string is a set of characters enclosed in a single or double quotes.

for ex: name="course"

here "name " is the variable name, "course" is the "value"

string_var="Hello everyone"

echo $string_var
or
echo ${string_var}

echo ${#string_var} --> lenght of the varibale
echo ${string_var:20} --> to ignore first 20 characters
echo ${string_var:20:15} --> first number represents how many charcters to ignore, how many to display, 
echo ${string_var: -8} last 8 characters will dsplay
echo ${string_var:0:2} to display first 2 characters

Arthimatic Operations:
----------------------
"expr" before the operation

ex: expr 2+3
  expr 3 - 2
  
  to display multiplication use escape character "expr 2\*3"
  
  echo "The addition of 2 nad 4 is: " `expr 2+4`
  

to Perfom arthimetic operations

filename.sh 2 3

mention in file like expr $1 + $2

here $1 first argument i.e., $1=2
here $2 second argument i.e., $2=3

make our shellscript interactivemode:
--------------------------------------

echo "Please neter your favourite dish: "
read dish
echo "The dish whoih you have typed is : " $dish


echo "what are all your DevOps tools: "
read DevOpstools

echo "The tools your typed are: " ${DevOpstools}
----------------------------------------------------
variable: is a single memory locaiton where we can store one value
Array: is  a continuos memeory locaiton,

echo "Please type the Devops tools"
read -a DevOpstools
echo "Display the 4th value is : " ${DevOpstools[3]} index start from "0"


read -p "Please enter our bank username: " username

echo "The user name which you have typed is: " $username
echo "The password which you have typed is: " $password


Shellscript-5
--------------
> --> redirect standard outpur
>> --> append stadard output
< --> standard input


 ls > lsopt.txt  redirect the out put 
 ls >> lsopt.txt  overrise the file
 
 
file descriptors:
----------------
0 ---> std i/p input
1 ---> std o/put
2 ---> std error

only out is redirec to the file

both out put and error to display 

sh filename.sh > filename.log 2>&1 to redirect out put and error both in pne file we will use this file descriptors

sh filename.sh 2> error.log 1> output.log

error will display in error file, output in putput file,

git commands--1
-----------------

create a directory with name of repository what we created in GIT

git init
development team will use IDEs--> Integrated Developement Environment

Java IDEs are
Eclipse
MyEclipse
Intellij


if it is a Nodejs/ReachJS/Angular JS we are going to use VISUAL STUDION CODE


working area               Staging area       Local repo
-------------              --------------     -------------
cleanup.sh
vi DBUtils.java           DBUtils.java      --> git commit -m "First commit"
Stringutils.java          Stringutils.java
Deploy.java   ----> git add.
                    git add *
					git add*.java
					git add DBUtils.java deplo.java
                    (if we want to move more than one file )
git status will give where 
the files are available


execute two commands, after install gitbash

git config --global user.name "Bhuvanabhuvi"
git config --global user.email "bhuvanamohan8185@gmail.com"
git config --global --list  to check either we did correct config or not

first execute

git init

create files
execute "git add ."


excute "git commit -m "my first commit" "  -m is message

then to connect with remote repo, got ot my organizations, click on bankingzone, click on repo, take the url

execute " git remote add aliasname remoterepourlofgit"

git remote add cb https://github.com/Bankingzone/citibank.git

for fetching and push we are going to use same url

git remote -v  (to know aliasname)

"git push cb master "(once execute all the files going to move remote repo)

once push above command, git hub credentials
username:Bhuvanabhuvi
password:PAT (PERSONAL ACCESS TOKEN)

PAT GENERAL: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

clear

go to windows credentials manager, delete the old git account , then execute "git push cb master"

if the file already commited in to git 

then we can execute the command "git commit -a -m "updated" " to update modified file


"each commit is going to maintain one commit id, that is why we called  git as verison control system"

"git log DBUtils.java"


PAT BETA: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


"git log" will show the current branch and latest commit ID

" git log filename"
